aflibercept ave an altern strategi for inhibit tumour angiogenesi by vascular endotheli growth factor 
  
  
background aberr angiogenesi is  landmark featur in cancer which is import for prolifer growth and metastasi and is mediat by variou proangiogen factor 
 the vegf pathway is one of the most import and beststudi angiogen pathway 
 inhibit of thi pathway may provid clinic benefit to cancer patient 
 object strategi to inhibit the vegf pathway includ antibodi to vegf antibodi to the extracellular domain of vegfr or vegfr decoy receptor for vegf and tyrosin kinas inhibitor of vegfr are summar 
 method thi review outlin and compar the latest develop of these strategi with emphasi on aflibercept  novel decoy fusion protein of domain  of vegfr and domain  of vegfr with the fc fragment of igg

promot angiogenesi via manipul of vegf respons with notch signal 
  
  
promot angiogenesi via deliveri of vascular endotheli growth factor vegf and other angiogen factor is both  potenti therapi for cardiovascular diseas and  critic aspect for tissu regener 
 the recent demonstr that vegf signal is modul by the notch signal pathway howev suggest that inhibit notch signal may enhanc region neovascular by alter the respons of local endotheli cell to angiogen stimuli 
 we test thi possibl with in vitro assay use human endotheli cell as well as in  rodent hindlimb ischemia model 
 treatment of cultur human endotheli cell with dapt  gamma secretas inhibitor increas cell migrat and sprout format in respons to vegf stimul with  biphas depend on dapt concentr 
 further deliveri of an appropri combin of dapt and vegf from an inject algin hydrogel system into ischem hindlimb led to  faster recoveri of blood flow than vegf or dapt alon perfus level reach  of the normal level by week  with combin dapt and vegf deliveri 
 direct intramuscular or intraperiton inject of dapt did not result in the same level of improv suggest that appropri present of dapt gel deliveri is import for it activ 
 dapt deliveri from the hydrogel also did not lead to ani advers side effect in contrast to system introduct of dapt 
 altogeth these result suggest  new approach to promot angiogenesi by control notch signal and may provid new option to treat patient with diseas that diminish angiogen respons
