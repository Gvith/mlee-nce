 in brain receptor for vegf have been local to vascular endothelium neuron and glia 
 vegf is upregul after hypox injuri to the brain which can occur dure cerebr ischemia or highaltitud edema and ha been implic in the bloodbrain barrier breakdown associ with these condit 
 given it recentlydescrib role as an inflammatori mediat vegf could also contribut to the inflammatori respons observ in cerebr ischemia 
 after seizur bloodbrain barrier breakdown and inflamm is also observ in brain albeit on  lower scale than that observ after stroke 
 recent evid ha suggest  role for inflamm in seizur disord 
 we have describ strike increas in vegf protein in both neuron and glia after pilocarpineinduc statu epilepticu in the brain 
 increas in vegf could contribut to the bloodbrain barrier breakdown and inflamm observ after seizur 
 howev vegf ha also been shown to be neuroprotect across sever experiment paradigm and henc could potenti protect vulner cell from damag associ with seizur 
 therefor the role of vegf after seizur could be either protect or destruct

 it is also clear that diffus angiogen stimuli can be releas not onli from most solid tumor but also from at least three nonneoplast cell 
 these includ activ macrophag sensit lymphocyt and adipocyt 
 other normal tissu can also stimul angiogenesi but the type of cell give rise to the angiogen stimulu is unknown and the period of angiogen stimul is brief 
 with the recent abil to clone capillari endotheli cell and to carri them in longterm cultur it ha been possibl to further delin the mechan of capillari growth 
 in vitro studi have shown that the mast cell seem to behav as  helper cell for capillari endotheli cell in some way speed up their rate of direct migrat 
 at thi write heparin appear to be the princip mast cell factor respons for thi effect on capillari endotheli cell 
 one theoret possibl is that mast cell may prepar the matrix perhap by slow releas of heparin so that capillari sprout can more easili move through it toward their angiogen target 
 while the studi of angiogenesi as  phenomenon is still in an earli phase it ha becom possibl by use  combin of in vitro and in vivo techniqu to more thoroughli understand the initi and control of capillari growth

in central serou chorioretinopathi cscr laser treatment of leak point close to the macular center should be avoid becaus of the possibl of produc juxtafov scotoma and stimul choroid neovascular 
 nine eye of nine consecut patient with cscr had two or more leak point within  macular detach one of which wa foveal or near to the fovea 
 photocoagul with green argon laser wa perform in all eye treat all the leak point except for the central one 
 visual symptom regress after treatment and the serou detach wa resolv  day to  week after photocoagul in all case 
 fluorescein angiographi show no leakag at either the central leakag point or the leakag point that had been treat 
 these result led us to believ that the central or depend leak in our case wa not suffici to maintain the serou detach by itself 
 an altern hypothesi is that the untreat leak did not repres real fluid movement but onli diffus of fluorescein molecul or  fals leak 
 in case of cscr with multipl leak within  singl macular detach we believ that  foveal leak may be  depend or fals leak and that direct treatment is not necessari

role of thrombin in angiogenesi and tumor progress 
  
  
clinic laboratori histopatholog and pharmacolog evid support the notion that the coagul system which is activ in most cancer patient play an import role in tumor biolog 
 our laboratori ha provid evid that thrombin activ angiogenesi  process which is essenti in tumor growth and metastasi 
 thi event is independ of fibrin format 
 at the cellular level mani action of thrombin can contribut to activ of angiogenesi  
 thrombin decreas the abil of endotheli cell to attach to basement membran protein 
  
 thrombin greatli potenti vascular endotheli growth factor vegf induc endotheli cell prolifer 
 thi potenti is accompani by upregul of the express of vegf receptor kinas insert domaincontain receptor kdr and fmslike tyrosin kinas flt 
  
 thrombin increas the mrna and protein level of alpha vbeta  integrin and serv as  ligand to thi receptor 
 furthermor thrombin increas the secret of vegf and enhanc the express and protein synthesi of matrix metalloproteas and alpha vbeta  integrin in human prostat cancer pc cell 
 these result could explain the angiogen and tumor promot effect of thrombin and provid the basi for develop of thrombin receptor mimet or antagonist for therapeut applic

 thi studi examin the mechan of hka and d inhibit of two potent stimul of endotheli cell migrat sphingosin phosphat sp and vascular endotheli growth factor vegf that act through the pkinaseakt signal pathway 
 hka and d inhibit bovin pulmonari arteri endotheli cell bpae or human umbil vein endotheli cell chemotaxi in the modifiedboyden chamber in respons tovegf or sp 
 the inhibit of migrat by hka is revers by antibodi to urokinasetyp plasminogen activ receptor 
 both hka and d decreas the speed of bpae cell migrat and alter the morpholog in live timelaps microscopi after stimul with sp or vegf 
 hka and d reduc the local of paxillin to the focal adhes after sp and vegf stimul 
 to better understand the intracellular signal pathway we examin the effect of hka on the phosphoryl of akt and it downstream effector gskalpha hka and d inhibit phosphoryl of akt and gskalpha after stimul withvegf and sp 
 inhibitor of akt and pkinas the upstream activ of akt block endotheli cell migrat and disrupt paxillin local to the focal adhes after stimul with vegf and sp 
 therefor we suggest that hka through it d domain alter pkinaseakt signal to inhibit endotheli cell migrat through alter in the focal adhes

 vascular histomorphometri wa carri out in two differ area in the distract gap  in the first and  in the second  mm area from the osteotomi line repres the oldest and younger newbon area respect 
 correl analysi wa perform between blood vessel paramet and the amount of new bone form dure distract 
 histolog analysi demonstr the presenc of blood vessel throughout the soft connect tissu in the distract gap 
 the volum densiti of blood vessel between the two investig area wa significantli lower in the  mmday group suggest  delay in angiogenesi in thi group of patient 
  posit correl between blood vessel volum and bone volum densiti wa found in the younger newbon area but not in the oldest newbon area 
 thi correl wa due to  higher number of blood vessel rather than to  larger size of the blood vessel 
 our data suggest that the lower blood vessel densiti found in the patient with  mmday distract rate may be relat to disrupt of angiogenesi in the soft connect tissu of the gap or to  less optim mechan stimul of cell involv in angiogenesi 
 thi probabl result in the slower rate of osteogenesi seen at the  mmday distract rate compar with the  
 mmday distract rate 
 the data support the concept that  posit relationship exist between the densiti of blood vessel and the format of bone 
 for distract of the human mandibl in elderli patient  distract rate of

 express of vegfc wa reduc p  less than   
 
 nevertheless the repress of vegfc wa lost in mutant vhl cell line under hypoxia 
 in contrast vegfb wa not regul by vhl despit clear upregul in vivo 
 these find strongli support an enhanc role for thi pathway in clear cell carcinoma by regul angiogenesi andor lymphangiogenesi 
 the studi show that clear cell tumor are abl to upregul angiogen growth factor receptor more effici than chromophil papillari that clear cell tumor can use pathway independ of vhl to regul angiogenesi and that thi combin regul may account for their more aggress phenotyp which suggest that target vegfr fltl may be particularli effect in these tumor type
