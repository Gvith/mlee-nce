 in mani diseas state bodi lose control over angiogenesi 
 angiogenesi depend diseas result when new blood vessel either grow excess or insuffici 
 insuffici angiogenesi occur in diseas such as coronari arteri diseas stroke and chronic wound 
 myocardi ischemia both acut and chronic ha been clearli shown to stimul angiogenesi in mani experiment model 
 therapeut angiogenesi is the biolog agent or bioactiv materi to stimul the growth of new blood vessel 
 tradit coronari revascular therapi such as coronari angioplasti or bypass graft surgeri act by restor blood flow through the preexist coronari vessel 
 one limit of these approach howev may be the failur to normal myocardi perfus due to the concomit presenc or small of resist vessel diseas 
 in contrast therapeut angiogenesi is base on the concept that coronari collater develop may be stimul by pharmacolog or molecular mean and can limit myocardi ischemia 
 studi both in human and anim model support the notion that variou angiogen growth factor and progenitor cell can enhanc new blood vessel 
 vascular endotheli growth factor vegf fibroblast growth factor fgf recombin protein and bone marrow stem cell are current use therapeut stimul for angiogenesi
